# 🧠 Customer Churn Prediction & Retention Strategy

## 📌 Overview
This project uses predictive modeling, statistical testing, and advanced analytics to identify customers at risk of churn and propose data-driven retention strategies. It simulates a real-world B2C scenario such as telecom, SaaS, or financial services.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Predict which customers are most likely to churn in the next 30 days
- Design and evaluate targeted intervention strategies
- Communicate actionable insights to product and marketing teams

## 📊 Key Features
- SQL-based data ingestion for reproducible analytics
- EDA and advanced feature engineering
- ML Models: Logistic Regression, XGBoost, LSTM
- Time-series forecasting with ARIMA
- A/B testing for retention campaign effectiveness
- Streamlit dashboard

## 🧰 Tech Stack
- **Languages:** Python, SQL
- **Libraries:** scikit-learn, XGBoost, TensorFlow, statsmodels, SHAP, seaborn
- **Tools:** Jupyter, Streamlit, Power BI
- **Cloud (Optional):** AWS S3, GCP BigQuery
- **Version Control:** Git + GitHub
