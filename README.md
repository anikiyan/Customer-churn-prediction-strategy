## 📌 Overview

A full-cycle machine learning project that uses predictive modeling, statistical testing, and advanced analytics to identify at-risk customers and recommend targeted retention strategies. Simulates a real-world B2C scenario such as telecom, SaaS, or financial services.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Predict which customers are most likely to churn in the next 30 days
- Design and evaluate targeted intervention strategies
- Communicate actionable insights to product and marketing teams

## 📊 Key Features
- SQL-based data ingestion for reproducible analytics
- EDA and advanced feature engineering
- ML Models: Logistic Regression, XGBoost, LSTM
- Time-series forecasting with ARIMA
- A/B testing for retention campaign effectiveness
- Streamlit dashboard for executive reporting  


## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **Languages:** Python, SQL
- **Libraries:** scikit-learn, XGBoost, TensorFlow, statsmodels, SHAP, seaborn
- **Tools:** Jupyter, Streamlit, Power BI
- **Cloud (Optional):** AWS S3, GCP BigQuery
- **Version Control:** Git + GitHub

## 📈 Sample Use Case

> A telecom company wants to reduce churn by 10% next quarter.  
This project identifies high-risk customers and evaluates which targeted campaigns statistically reduce churn, using uplift modeling and A/B testing.

##  Next Steps
- [✅] Define scope and goals
- [✅] Load and inspect data
- [✅] Conduct EDA and feature generation
- [✅] Train baseline and advanced ML models
- [✅] Evaluate A/B test outcomes
- [✅] Build dashboard/report for stakeholders
